Hi 👋 My name is Faizan Rasool
==============================

Electrical Engineering Student @ McMaster University
----------------------------------------------------

I currently work at Hydro One (Mississauga, ON) as an AMI Network Analyst (Co-op). During my co-op I have had the oppurtunity to work on a variety of projects, including designing and creating an employee performance tracker, used by the leadership team (VBA). I also designed a tool which detected the over/under usage of several thousands meters for which customers were billed inaccurately (VBA + SQL). 

<br/>

Outside of work, I have utilized my skills and passion for programming and have created various projects. Some of technologies I have used include:  JavaScript ES6+, React.js, Node.js, Python, Matlab , HTML + CSS and more!
